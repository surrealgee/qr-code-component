## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This one was pretty easy to complete, my intention here was to get started with project based learning.

I intent to develop new projects every week to find gaps in my knowledge and become a better developer overall.

### Continued development

I don't see the need to add more features to this projects for the moment.

What I want to do is improve my writing skills be writing documentation about my projects.

That's why started with this easy one so I could focus on writing this document and establishing a baseline for future projects.
